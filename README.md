This notebook presents a comprehensive workflow for building a multiclass classifier to categorize customer IT support tickets using a custom string kernel with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). 

The primary aim is to experiment with language-based classification from raw ticket texts and compare the performance of the SVM approach with other classifiers like Random Forest or XGBoost.

The dataset used is the "Customer IT Support - Ticket Dataset", comprising 20,000 multilingual support tickets.
